The design was based off a Texas Instrument 30XS Multiview Calculator.

## Summary
The goal of this Odin Project assignment was to create a functioning calculator using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The calculator is functioning for the most part; however, I have yet to include error messages, implemented regex to prevent the use of multiple decimals or a missing parentheses, or a maximum character display limit. 

I used javascript to allow users to choose between two colorways.

## Resources
I designed the UI prior to realizing the actual scope and knowledge required to create a scientific calculator as compared to a four function calculator.

So I decided to use math.js, an extensive javascript and node.js library, to parse expressions and run a large number of complex functions commonly found on a standard scientific calculator. 


Some of the buttons present on the actual Texas Instrument 30XS Multiview don't have a math.js equivalent, and are present more so for the sake of preserving the design.
