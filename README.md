# calculator

Creating a calculator for the Odin project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
Currently only contains the user interface. Designed based on the TI-30XS.

Javascipt used to create a color changer. Allows user to pick between two colorways. 

Update: I have learned media queries so the the calculator is now semi-responsive on mobile. 

Update #2: The calculator is now functional;however, I have yet to implement error messages and fixed bugs. The assignment called for a four function calculator but after making the UI I decided to use the math.js library and make the calculator scientific. There are still many functions missing that I will hopefully add in the future. Also made some minor UI changes. 

Right now the calculator does the four basic functions, and is able to parse expressions with parentheses.
